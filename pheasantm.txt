GENERAL: The status and
behaviour of this species are hard
to specify beacuse of the frequent
presence of young birds reared
and released, unprepared for life
in the wild, to be shot.
NESTING: Hollow on ground,
under overhanging cover such as
brambles, unlined or thin
scatterings of grass stems.
FEEDING: Seeds and berries,
insects and lizards.
