GENERAL: Easily confused
with the larger Raven and Rook.
Carrion Crows tend to be more
solitary than Rooks, but will
often roost in scores together
and occasionally feed in flocks.
NESTING: Big stick nest,
shallower than Rook's, in tree
or bush.
FEEDING: Invertebrates,
eggs, grain and various scraps;
often in pairs, sometimes big
flocks on fields.
