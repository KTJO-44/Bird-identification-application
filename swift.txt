more aerial than the Swift. They
appear in Europe late in spring and
depart for Africa early in Autumn.
Flocks fly very high or at rooftop
level; seldom seen perching on
wires or clinging to walls or roofs
like martins and swallows.
NESTING: Feather-lined cavity
in building, more rarely in cliff.
FEEDING: Entirely aerial,
taking flying insects in bill.
