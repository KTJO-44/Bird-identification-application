GENERAL: Uses houses for
nesting. It is not a garden bird,
though, but an aerial one, feeding
over the housetops, coming down
only to pick up mud to build its
nest.
NESTING: Enclosed mud nest
with entrance at top, fixed under
eaves or overhang.
FEEDING: Catches flying
insects and drifting spiders, high
in air, in its mouth.
