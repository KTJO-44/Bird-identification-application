GENERAL: A small, lively,
sociable finch, the Linnet breeds
in small colonies and feeds in
flocks all year round. Flocks
move together, tightly coordinated
unlike the looser aggregations
formed by Chaffinches.
NESTING: Neat little nest of
stems and roots, lined with hair.
FEEDING: Often feeds in groups
all year, on seeds, taken from
ground; young fed on insects;
rarely comes to gardens.
