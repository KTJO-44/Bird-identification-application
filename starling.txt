GENERAL: Starlings form dense,
noise flocks; no other small bird,
apart from shoreline waders,
creats such vast flocks that look
like clouds of smoke at a distance.
NESTING: Loose, bulky nest of
grass and stems, lined with roots,
moss, wool and feathers, in tree
hole, cavity, in building or wall,
or large nest box.
FEEDING: In flocks, finding
invertebrates, seeds, and berries
on ground; catches flying ants.
