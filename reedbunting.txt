GENERAL: Easy to find and
identify in summer. Males sing
monotonously from low perches
in the wetland vegetation. In
winter, males are far less striking.
NESTING: Bulky nest of
grass, sedge, and other stems,
lined with roots and hair, on or
close to ground in thick cover.
FEEDING: Insects in summer,
seeds at other times, taken in
low bushes or on ground, often
on open grass near water.
