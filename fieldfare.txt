GENERAL: Flocks in fight
keep more or less together but
drift along in irregular lines and
shapeless packs, less coordinated
than, for example, some smaller
finches.
NESTING: Cup of grass and
twigs, in bush or tree, often in
loose colonies.
FEEDING: Mostly eats worms
and insects on ground; also takes
apples, berries and other fruit
from trees, hedges and bushes.
