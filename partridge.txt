GENERAL: Quite elusive birds
of warm, open, stony slopes and
fields; in the UK, they prefer light
soils in arable areas. They are
often seen perched on haystacks,
barns and farm buildings.
NESTING: Grass-lined hollow
scrape on ground beneath low
vegetation.
FEEDING: Leaves, shoots,
berries, acorns and seeds,
including beech-mast picked up
from ground; chicks eat insects.
