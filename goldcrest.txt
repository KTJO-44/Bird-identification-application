GENERAL: Europe's smallest bird,
the Goldcrest, may sometimes be
watched at an arm's length as it
feeds in lower branches of trees.
It is oblivious to the presence of
people, generally ignoring them.
NESTING: Tiny cup of cobwebs,
moss and lichens, slung beneath
branch.
FEEDING: Picks tiny insects,
spiders and insect eggs from
foliage, often hovering briefly.
