GENERAL: Can cling beneath a
branch, handing freely by its
toes, but usually sits upright,
propped up on its tail.
NESTING: Untidy nest behind
loose bark or ivy stem, sometimes
in nest box.
FEEDING: Takes insects, spiders
and other tiny items from bark,
probing with its bill as it
shuffles up or around trunks and
branches; also forages on walls,
and occasionally rocks.
