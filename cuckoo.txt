GENERAL: Cuckoos typically
perch low down in or on the edge
of trees, but are often easier to
see singing or calling from
telephone wires; they also fly
about from tree to tree, giving
frequent short flight views.
NESTING: Lays eggs in other
birds' nests.
FEEDING: Drops to ground to
pick up large, hairy caterpillars;
also eats small insects.
