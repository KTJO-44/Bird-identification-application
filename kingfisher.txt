GENERAL: Can be hard to spot.
Often its sharp call gives it
away, followed by a glimpse of
a bright blue back flying off
over water, but sometimes it
allows really close, clear views.
NESTING: Deep tubular tunnel,
lined with fish bones, in soft
earth cliff over water.
FEEDING: Catches fish,
small aquatic invertebrates,
and amphibians in dive from
perch or mid-air hover.
