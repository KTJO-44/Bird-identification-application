GENERAL: Widely distributed
in a great variety of places, like
the Wren. If disturbed, it generally
flies at near ground-level into the
nearest thick bush, and is
sometimes taken for some rare,
vagrant warbler.
NESTING: Small grassy cups,
lined with hair and moss, in bush
or hedge.
FEEDING: Small insects and
seeds; feeds on scraps beneath
bird-tables.
