GENERAL: Typically soars over
woods, perches inconspicuously,
or dashes by, low, with a flap-
flap-glide action. Bold enough to
hunt in gardens and parks, but is
essentially a forest-edge bird.
NESTING: Remarkably large,
flat-topped heap of sticks and
greenery close to trunk of tall tree.
FEEDING: Hunts boldly in forest
or clearings, catching birds
from thrush size to crows,
gamebirds; also mammals.
