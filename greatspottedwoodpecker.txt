GENERAL: The Great Spotted
Woodpecker announces itself in
spring by a loud drumming: a rapid,
abrupt 'drum roll' made by
hammering the bill against a
resonant branch.
NESTING: Digs hole, diameter
5-6cm in trunk or branch of tree.
FEEDING: Finds insects and
larvae beneath bark, digging them
out with strong bill; also takes
seeds and berries; visits gardens
for nuts, seeds, cheese and fat.
