GENERAL: All become elusive
after nesting, almost
'disappearing' for a time,
although they are frequent
migrants in coastal areas
later in autumn.
NESTING: Cup of leaves and
moss, in tree hole, old
woodpecker hole, or nest box.
FEEDING: Catches flies in air
and picks insects from foliage
and from ground; also eats
seeds and berries.
